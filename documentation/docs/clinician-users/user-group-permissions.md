These user groups are linked to one or multiple Trust/Health Boards which are providing epilepsy care to children and/or young people. Users are assigned to an 'organisation', which is defined as individual hospitals/sites/community services within one Trust/Health Board. 

Users will only have access to the data relating to their own Trust/Health Board. They may see children and users at other organisations within their Trust/Health Board.
