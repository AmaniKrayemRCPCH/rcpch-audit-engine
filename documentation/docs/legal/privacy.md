## National Data Opt Out Implementation (England only)

The Epilepsy12 audit is now exempt from the NHS National Data Opt-Out. Healthcare providers in England no longer need to screen patients against the opt-out list prior to entering their data. Patients can still opt out of Epilepsy12 specifically by contacting their clinical team. You can indicate this in the first year of care form and the record will be deleted. Please take a look at our methodology and data submission page for more information.
