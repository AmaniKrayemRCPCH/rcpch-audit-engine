Further information to on the Epilepsy12 API to follow.

The API exists to allow implementers of Epilepsy12 to autopopulate some fields in the Epilepsy12 audit with data from their own systems such as their EPR, PAS or other systems.

At present none of our end user trusts have indicated they would like to use this feature. If you are interested in using the API please contact us.
