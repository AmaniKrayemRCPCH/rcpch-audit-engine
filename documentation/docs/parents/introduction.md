## Childhood Epilepsy

Epilepsy affects around one in every 200 children and young people in the UK (aged 18 and under). The condition is one of the most common significant long-term health conditions of childhood.

Epileptic seizures can happen in any part of the brain cortex and what happens depends on where in the brain the seizure is happening. Seizures can be distressing but it's not just the seizures that are the problem. Children and young people may experience issues with learning, behaviour and emotions.

Epilepsy can have a huge impact on children and families. That's why children and parents need support and guidance from healthcare professionals throughout the stages of diagnosis and treatment.
