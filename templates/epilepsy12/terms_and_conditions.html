            </p>
            <li>Fair Processing Statement</li>
            <p>
                The RCPCH has HSCA Section 251 approval for Epilepsy12 to collect patient identifiable data without explicit patient consent (see reference: 17/CAG/0184 towards the bottom of the spreadsheet under the full project name of the "UK collaborative clinical
                audit of health care for children and young people with suspected epileptic seizures". This data is processed and reported by the Epilepsy12 project team within the RCPCH with the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) as the
                Data Controller. Full details of fair processing documentation for the collection of patient identifiable information without consent in Health Boards and Trusts in England and Wales will be added to this page prior to the start of the
                clinical audit data entry phase. Copies of these materials will also be provided to participating Health Boards and Trusts to display in clinic areas and share with their patients and family members. HQIP may approve the sharing of pseudonymised
                Epilepsy12 data for the purpose of service improvement if stringent data protection policies and arrangements can be demonstrated by requestees and the aims of the service improvement are approved. Epilepsy12 data may also be linked to
                data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). NHS Digital and the NHS Wales Informatics Service may provide HES, PEDW and ONS data to Epilepsy12
                in an anonymous format. The linked data would then be analysed by the Epilepsy12 project team at the RCPCH to further help to measure standards of care. If patients or their parents do not wish to have their data submitted to the audit
                by their hospital, they should instruct their paediatric epilepsy hospital team to not include their data in their annual submission to the Epilepsy12 team. Clinics in England should apply the NHS opt out process and not submit data from
                patients who have opted out.
