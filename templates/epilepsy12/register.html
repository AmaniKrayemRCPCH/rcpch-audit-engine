There are 7 steps to complete. The 'clock begins' when the child has had their first paediatric assessment for the episode(s) ultimately treated as epileptic. The audit covers all that is achieved during the first 12 months of care after this first paediatric assessment. Each child is assigned to a cohort according to their first paediatric assessment date and ultimately contributes to the audit against the trust who is providing ongoing 'secondary care' at the 12 months point after that first paediatric assessment. All fields are mandatory and can be completed in any order. Progress is saved automatically. The audit steps will not become active until the child has been registered, a 'secondary care' trust site has been allocated and eligibility has been verified.
